Swin-DepthResidualSeg: We have proposed a hybrid model "Swin-DepthResidualSeg ", which integrates components of the Swin Transformer and a CNN architecture based on residual blocks. This model constructs an architecture that combines a multi-scale CNN and transformer design with skip connections linking them, serving as input to the Swin Transformer. In this architecture, traditional convolutional layers are replaced with depth-wise separable layers

Model Overview
1)Depth-wise Separable Convolutions for efficient local feature extraction with reduced parameter overhead.

2)Swin Transformer with powerful attention mechanisms that capture global dependencies and enhance contextual understanding.

3)Skip Connections that merge CNN and transformer representations to optimize feature learning and improve overall model output
